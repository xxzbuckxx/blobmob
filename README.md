# Blob-Mob
Javascript Canvas Game

Blobmob is an html5 Canvas game that was created during 2016 for coding practice.

Blobmob was originally designed on a chromebook webstie HTML compilier but was moved to a github repository in its final stages. All previous saves are owned and available in google drive if needed; music and sound effects made on garageband; sound utilizing howler.js.

# Compile

Javascript needs to be minified/compiled into `scripts.js`. I used
[Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/fstrube/closure-auto-compiler) but
any js minifier works
